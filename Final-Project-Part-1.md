### **Final Project Part 1**


### **Description:**

Our Sentiments vs Reality of AI's Impact: How Worried Should We Be?

The topic of AI is widely contested within our current times. Generative AI in particular has become widespread in many sectors. In my particular case, as someone who is an artist and has artist peers, the topic of AI implementation in the workplace is continuously debated due to its danger towards illustrators. Therefore, with my existing interest in AI’s influences, I wish to delve further into how this technology is adopted in other sectors. 

Therefore, my final project will center on comparing perceptions of AI’s impact on jobs with the realities of its implementation in the workplace. Are people’s worries warranted? Are people’s careers at risk with the adoption of AI? Using two main data sources, one from OECD and the other from APA, I will be focusing on both this trend’s effect on our mental health as well as the efficiency of workplaces. 


### **Outline:**
Setup: AI has had rapid growth within the past few years, impacting our workforce more and more by the day
Statement:  With growing worries over AI’s impact on the workplace, how do our sentiments measure up to the reality of its influence? How worried should we be about our future workplace?
include slide detailing AI’s growth (text)
Conflict: the integration of AI in the workplace has brought upon greater efficiency but simultaneously certain workers risk losing their jobs
Slides on how AI integration leads to more poor mental health and survey results on negative feelings or reactions to this trend (APA) pie charts, bar graphs
Slides on the positive effects of AI integration: increase in efficiency (OECD) 
Highlight what types of individuals benefit and which do not
Resolution: highlighting the limitations of AI and spreading more awareness on this topic.
Using mainly text and a stacked bar graph, I will show how employees and employers view human skills as being more important with the growth of AI (OECD)

### **Sketches:**


### **Data:**

The first data source I will be using is workforce AI research from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, otherwise known as OECD. With the goal of recording workers and employers' perceptions on the impact of AI in their workplaces, 2,053 firms and 5,334 workers from 7 different countries were surveyed.Two surveys were conducted, one focused on the employers and the other for the worker’s. I plan to use their data to focus on which individuals benefit and which don’t benefit from the growth of AI in the workplace, revealing not only the differences in management vs employee but how demographics play a part.

The second data source is from American Psychology Association or APA. Their research focuses more on the psychological aspect of AI’s advancement and further involvement. Their study looks into the emotional responses from people as well as how AI impacts their mental well-being. While the first data source looks more at AI’s direct effect on work efficiency, APA targets our sentiments towards the technology. With its survey data, I will compare its findings with OECD’s findings when it comes to attitudes towards AI in the workplace. From thereon, I try to discern if the questions and other factors posed had any influence on the results.

### **Method & Medium:**

For this final project, I will use both Shorthand and Tableau. Using Tableau, I will form my data visualizations from the public survey data mentioned above. OECD already has a .csv file available, and I intend to convert the data from the APA study into a .csv file to better work with Tableau.  On the other hand, Shorthand will serve as a basis for tying in my entire story in one cohesive source. For other visuals such as photos, I will likely use free adobe stock photos.
