### **Portfolio**
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  

### **About me**
My name is Tricia Park, and I use she/her pronouns. I am a current graduate student and have a background in fine arts. After graduating from Cornell University for undergrad, I am currently completing Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Arts Management program. My interests lie in fundraising, and I aim to work in a development position at a nonprofit arts organization, preferably a museum.

I possess skills in prospect research, donor stewardship, and events management. Before coming to Carnegie Mellon University, my experience comprised of teaching, administrative duties, and docent work. As a graduate student, I hope my courses will contribute to a greater understanding of nonprofit leadership.

On my leisure time, I enjoy rekindling my love of fine arts. Painting and actively filling a sketchbook is my way of exercising my creativity. I also enjoy volunteering at local arts organizations in Pittsburgh.

### **What I hope to learn**
Through this class, I wish to be equipped with the knowledge on how to recognize design flaws and the best practices of tailoring visuals to a particular audience. From my summer internship at a consulting company, I've grown to realize the importance of good data visualization. It is often the key to whether a client understands and is satisfied with final recommendations. 

Whether I become a consultant after graduation or pursue a different career, the ability to express data in a way that's compelling and straightforward is essential to convincing the other party of your research, recommendations, or prosposal. I imagine adding data visualizations to any project will only enhance its quality, and I am particularly interested in color theory and expressing a narrative through visual data.

When comparing the efficiency of a heatmap and a bar chart in visualizing data, it largely comes down to the amount of data one wants to include. The data used for the second and third visualizations is taken from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and includes the yearly general government debts of 35 countries within a 1995-2019 time frame. The first visualization encompasses most of this data, including the debts of all countries with the exception of Columbia from 1995 to 2019. A heat map allows the inclusion of a large amount of data and is ideal for portraying an overall trend or pattern.

With this contrast of warm orange and blue, readers are able to quickly identify which countries have higher government debts and see a trend of most countries debts increasing by the year. On the other hand, the third visualization focuses on a subset of the data. Looking at the debts of the USA only, from 2006 to 2016, I chose a bar chart to represent this data for it contains fewer variables. A bar chart allows for each individual value to stand out on its own, and I was able to easily bring attention to the the 2008 government debt for the chart to portray the 2008 financial crisis' impact on U.S. debt. I used gray to color all the bars with exception of the 2008 bar being a bright red. 


### **Data Visualization #1**



### **Assignment 3&4: Critique by Design**


### **Step 1: Choose Data Visualization**

Original Data Visualization: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/?tabItem=3345cffa-94a6-4e74-9272-70dee1e0e213#who-uses-each-social-media-platform 

I chose this particualar data visualization because it made realize my biases and misunderstandings of social media. The data in this graph that surprised me in particular were the popularity of Facebook and Youtube. As someone who is in my early twenties, I've mistakenly believed that platforms such as Instagram or Tiktok would be used the most of US adults. However, I failed to account for those who are older than me. I felt that this graph was quite informative and would be very impactful for those who use multiple social media platforms such as myself. Yet, despite my interest in its data, I felt that aspects such as color, layout, and text all contributed to my confusion when reading the graph. I felt that as someone who is quite familiar with the social media platforms listed, the colors and layout of the graph were too complicated or did not align with the actual platforms themselves. 

### **Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization**

What stood out to me first was the vertical grey line near the 2023 year mark, the large amount of points, and arbitrary colors on the graph. I found the grey threshold line to be effective, indicating a change in survey mode while also not stopping the viewer's focus when studying the lines. However, I found the points on the graph to be distracting, shifting my attention away from the trajectory of the lines to trying to discern their purpose. There is no context given to clarify what exactly they are marking or why they are needed. Moreover, the viewing the colors aroused confusion in me as they appeared to be arbitrarily assigned. Some of them do not align with their respective social media platform. While Facebook is depicted as blue, WhatsApp is depicted as a dark grey. If I were to change at least one thing about this visualization, I would remove the points as they seemed unnecessary and not useful to the viewer.

The primary audience for this tool are those who use multiple social media platforms. The visualization is partially effective for reaching said audience since it encompasses a wide breath of social media platforms and immediately informs the viewer which platforms are popular and not so popular: the wide gap between Youtube and Facebook with the rest of the platforms. On the other hand, the design is not very intuitive the more you study the graph. As someone who would be part of the target audience, the colors did not match the associations I have with each social media. Moreover, with further observation, the order of the key does not align the order of the lines (Nextdoor and Bereal).

I thought this method of data visualization evaluation was very successful. In particular, evaluating the graph starting out with usefulness brought out glaring details very quickly such as the points. The measures not being fully captured here are usefulness, perceptibility, and intuitiveness. My further recommendations for this visualization is to change the color key and layout of the key. I noticed that for the social media platforms with low trajectories are mostly neutral tones, resulting in a low visual contrast near the bottom of the graph. I would change the colors to represent the platforms more accurately and make sure to have a balance of dark and light vivid tones. Furthermore, currently, the key appears too compact with visual information, making it difficult to match the lines with their respective social media. I would split the key into two parts, moving Youtube and Facebook upwards to be level with their lines, while moving the rest of the key downwards. Moreover, I would rearrange the platforms in the key to match the order of their lines. 

### **Step 3: Sketch out a Solution**

**Step 4: Interviews for Design Feedback:**

Interviewee: Student mid 20's

Preliminary design 
- What target audience do you think this is directed at?
  "Those in their 20s to 30s."
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
  "These line correspond to social media platforms. I'm seeing the trajectory of their popularity."
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  "I did not think Facebook would be this high and Tiktok so low. These results are pretty suprising to me."
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  "There's not much I would change, but maybe make the data points for Nextdoor and BeReal more noticeable? I barely saw where they were. Also, the legend could be cleaned up a bit."
- Is there anything you particularly like the most?
  "I really like the y and x axis, simple and to the point. I like how all the years a listed so I can look at a social media's popularity at specific points in time."



Interviewee: Student mid 20's

Preliminary design 2
- What target audience do you think this is directed at?
  "Those who use social media a lot, maybe even familiar with multiple of these on here"
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
  "It's telling me how many americans are using which social media, so basically showing you trends and the popularity of each platform over the years."
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  "I didn't know Facebook was still used so heavily! It must be because of my age bracket too, I mostly use Instagram and Tiktok."
  "Nothing is too confusing but I wonder why the timeline extends to 2024 when the data seems to end at around 2023."
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  "Maybe space out the lines a bit if that's possible? Since there are so many social media platforms represented here at the bottom, it seems a bit chaotic."
- Is there anything you particularly like the most?
  "I noticed how the colors of each line corresponds to the app designs. I love that little touch, and made it easier to recognize them too."


**Step 5: Final Data Visualization**

  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1731492550512');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                   
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                   
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);

Using Tableau, I was able to implement some of my recommendations from Step 2. I changed the colors of the social media platforms to align with their app colors, which fortunately created greater contrast and was more visually appealing to the viewer. Moreover, I rearranged the social media platforms in the key to reflect the order of the lines. However, I decided to exclude the threshold line as I expected that it wouldn't hold much significance to viewers who may not care how the data was polled. From the initial feedback on my first design, I found that the graph is easily read, but the points for Nextdoor and BeReal were barely noticeable and that the legend may feel overwhelming to study for the viewer. Therefore I worked out a solution that addresses the two issues. In my initial critique of the original data visualization, I proposed that I split the key into two and level them to their corresponding lines. Instead, I ended up labeling the lines directly, which means I would also be labeling the data points for Nextdoor and BeReal. Through this solution, I would be eliminating the need for a color key and allow the reader to find the data points fairly easily through the labels. 

With my second design, I eliminated the need for a color key as I was labeling each line and data point directly. I also added more information in the caption to explain why some lines start later than others in case viewers are confused at this detail. Moreover, I changed the title of the graph to include more context. The feedback I garnered from this design was more positive and the interviewee did notice my intention behind the colors, aligning with the actual color of the apps. However, there seems to confusion as to why my timeline extends to 2024 and that the bottom half of the graph still appears chaotic. Therefore, I looked for ways to space out the lines more and shorten the timeline to halfway through 2023.

For my final visualization, I wasn't able to find a way to space out the lines within Tableau. However, I did end up simplifying the y-axis to 
reduce visual clutter and direct more attention to the lines. I chose to keep the 10% as a placemarker; majority of the bottom data ranges from 10 to 20% at the start of the study. From thereon, I only made every 30% count visible and incldued tick marks signifying each 5% increase. I also simplified the x-axis as well to count every three years for similar reasons. Moreover, like in the original version, I included a reference line signifying changes in the survey method. Contrary to my earlier assumptions, during my visual feedback in class, two students mentioned they were interested in how the survey method may have changed the lines' trajectory. In the caption, I also specified the offical start and end dates of the polling.
