### **Portfolio**
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  

### **About me**
My name is Tricia Park, and I use she/her pronouns. I am a current graduate student and have a background in fine arts. After graduating from Cornell University for undergrad, I am currently completing Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Arts Management program. My interests lie in fundraising, and I aim to work in a development position at a nonprofit arts organization, preferably a museum.

I possess skills in prospect research, donor stewardship, and events management. Before coming to Carnegie Mellon University, my experience comprised of teaching, administrative duties, and docent work. As a graduate student, I hope my courses will contribute to a greater understanding of nonprofit leadership.

On my leisure time, I enjoy rekindling my love of fine arts. Painting and actively filling a sketchbook is my way of exercising my creativity. I also enjoy volunteering at local arts organizations in Pittsburgh.

### **What I hope to learn**
Through this class, I wish to be equipped with the knowledge on how to recognize design flaws and the best practices of tailoring visuals to a particular audience. From my summer internship at a consulting company, I've grown to realize the importance of good data visualization. It is often the key to whether a client understands and is satisfied with final recommendations. 

Whether I become a consultant after graduation or pursue a different career, the ability to express data in a way that's compelling and straightforward is essential to convincing the other party of your research, recommendations, or prosposal. I imagine adding data visualizations to any project will only enhance its quality, and I am particularly interested in color theory and expressing a narrative through visual data.
