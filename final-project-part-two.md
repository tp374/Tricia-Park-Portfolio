# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

# Outline 
Setup: AI has had rapid growth within the past few years, impacting our workforce more and more by the day

Statement:  With growing worries over AI’s impact on the workplace, how do our sentiments measure up to the reality of its influence? How worried should we be about our future workplace?

- include slide detailing AI’s growth: line graph
- accompanied with short paragraph summarizing AI's signifigance and growth worldwide

Conflict: the integration of AI in the workplace has brought upon greater efficiency but simultaneously certain workers risk losing their jobs

-  Slide on the positive effects of AI integration: increase in efficiency (OECD)
-  include pie chart showing you the % of how much AI improved work
  
-  Slide on how AI integration leads to more poor mental health and survey results on negative feelings or reactions to this trend (APA) pie charts, bar graphs
-  Stacked bar graph showing what proportion of workers are worried about AI

-  Slide on showing how much AI may shrink workforces
-  Include a bar chart on the percentage of employers that believe AI adoption increased or decreased employment

- Highlight what types of individuals benefit and which do not.
- Include horizontal bar chart that shows which demographics are more likely to be AI users. 

Resolution: highlighting the limitations of AI and spreading more awareness on this topic.

- Using mainly text and a bar graph, I will show how cost is the largest barrier to AI implementation.
- Call to Action: Become informed and share your knowledge with others. Learn how much your sector or your career specifically will be impacted by AI to better prepare for the future.
- Not only can you share this website page, but look into AI regulations, cost, and potential of Generative AI
- include a button that links to articles on AI regulation and the potential of Generative AI

## Target audience

Due to the rapid development and proliferation of AI technology in many sectors, my target audience is the general adult public, particularly those who are english speaking.
Seeing as how AI is a global phenomenon and the studies used bring in data from multiple countries, I've identified my target audience to be english speakers from the ages of 18 to 64. At the age of 18, individuals enter college and having to decide what career path to take which is impacted by the advancement of AI while the retirement age worldwide is 64. Whether one is working an entry level position or the head of a company, learning about the effects of AI on the workplace and morale is crucial. Therefore, I will be targeting a wide range of people.

## Interview findings


| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|How relevant do you think the data vizualizations are to the rest of the page's context?| They believed it aligned with what they expected from the corresponding text.| They thought the visuals were very relevant and love how it expands on the factors impacting AI's effect. | |
|Were there any parts of the content that confused you? | The information from the demographic bar chart seems to highlight those who will be negatively impacted but the text focuses on those who will benefit, so this contrast is confusing| Nothing really confused them, but they suggested adding real life examples of certain companies that benefit or did not benefit from AI|             |
|How likely are you to share this page with your peers or family?| They think it would be great to share with those who don't know much about AI such as my family and some friends.| The are likely to share this page with their co-workers since AI is a growing topic within the biomedical field as well. |             |
|Did you identify a call to action?|They did identify a call to action and like how it recommends to educate not only yourself but others | The did identify a call to action and appreciate how there are links to further information to further inform yourself|             |
|How did this page make you feel?|  It made them feel compelled to learn more.| It made them more alert to the risks of AI.|             |
|Is there anything that confused you when it came to the data visualizations?| When it comes to the work effiency stacked bar charts, re-organizing the bars so that decrease and increase are next to each other would reduce confusion when navigating the information. Moreover, they believe having separate colors for the pie charts regarding the Manufacturing industry will make it more clear for viewers| For the pie charts, they believe having only one color key, thus the same three colors for the pie charts will be better for clarity and simplicity|             |
|How long did it take you to digest all the information?| They digested the information pretty rapidly, understanding the context as they scrolled down and read more.| They believe it took about 5-10 minutes to fully digest all the information|             |

# Moodboards / personas

As my topic is on AI (Artificial Intellgience), my moodboard consists of colors and images the common person would think of, which are cold blue hues, circuit boards, and a web pattern.
