# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

# Outline 
Setup: AI has had rapid growth within the past few years, impacting our workforce more and more by the day

Statement:  With growing worries over AI’s impact on the workplace, how do our sentiments measure up to the reality of its influence? How worried should we be about our future workplace?

- include slide detailing AI’s growth (text and line graphs)

Conflict: the integration of AI in the workplace has brought upon greater efficiency but simultaneously certain workers risk losing their jobs

- Slides on how AI integration leads to more poor mental health and survey results on negative feelings or reactions to this trend (APA) pie charts, bar graphs

- Slides on the positive effects of AI integration: increase in efficiency (OECD) 

- Highlight what types of individuals benefit and which do not. Who will lose their jobs due to AI efficiency and who will not?

Resolution: highlighting the limitations of AI and spreading more awareness on this topic.

- Using mainly text and a bar graph, I will show how cost is the largest barrier to AI implementation.

## Target audience

Due to the rapid development and proliferation of AI technology in many sectors, my target audience is the general adult public, particularly those who are english speaking.
Seeing as how AI is a global phenomenon and the studies used bring in data from multiple countries, I've identified my target audience to be english speakers from the ages of 18 to 64. At the age of 18, individuals enter college and having to decide what career path to take which is impacted by the advancement of AI while the retirement age worldwide is 64. Whether one is working an entry level position or the head of a company, learning about the effects of AI on the workplace and morale is crucial. Therefore, I will be targeting a wide range of people.
