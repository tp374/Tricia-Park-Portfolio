# Final Writeup

The project began with brainstorming an issue or topic I wished to explore in more depth. Since I was already familiar with the growth of generative AI within the arts sector and its negative impact on artists, I became curious about how AI implementation impacts other industries. 

In Part One of this process, my topic focused on the comparison of people's sentiments regarding AI's impact with the reality of its effects in the workplace. I created an outline that marked the setup (AI's growth and importance in the marketplace), conflict (integration of AI in the workplace leading to increase in work effiency but decrease in employment), and resolution (recognizing the limitations of AI and spreading awareness of its risks and benefits). I also prepared hand-drawn sketches of what types of data visualizations to include, using information from the following data sources: the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the American Psychology Association (APA), and Statistica. I also planned to use Shorthand to create my presentation and Tableau to create the final visualizations. 

In Part Two, I fleshed out my outline further to include specifics on what text and visualizations will be on which slide of the presentation. After I created a moodboard for my Shorthand slides, which set cool tones of dark and light blues as my visual theme, I created my first draft of the presentation. I also formed an interview script and gained feedback on its presentation, clarity, and engagement. Some key findings and potential changes I found are the mismatch in focus between the text and the visualizations and confusing formatting in the data visualizations. I also received further feedback from the professor and TA, which highlighted the need for clarity regarding the main points of the visualizations as well as relevancy of the presentation information to my target audience. My target audience was the general adult public, particularly those who are English-speaking, which was later changed in Part Three.

## The audience

In Part Three, I've taken the feedback from Part Two and decided to change my target audience, thus slightly altering the presentation topic. Narrowing down my target audience to organizations interested in adopting AI tools, I ultimately changed my focus from the employees to employers. While there is little employees can do to in the face of AI's tremendous growth, employers can be more cautious and pro-active in their efforts to mitigate the dangers of AI implementation. Ultimately, I had to change the The title of my presentation from "Our Sentiments vs Reality of AIâ€™s Impact: How Worried Should We Be?" to "Should You Implement AI in Your Workplace?" The call to action was also altered, prompting employers to conduct further research on AI trends in their industry and consult their own workers when deciding on AI adoption.


## Changes made since Part II 
Due to the change in target audience, many aspects of the presentation have been adjusted. The presenation is intended to provide an overview of the benefits and risks associated with AI adoption within the workplace. Its purpose is to inform organizations that implementing AI is a complex issue that require thorough study in advance. Based on the professor's feedback in Part Two, I provided clarifiaction regarding the data's focus on finance and manufacturing sectors. As AI usage is highly prevalent in those sectors compared to others, highlighting the risks and drawbacks of AI hint that similar issues may pop up in other sectors. However, at the end of the presentation, I also discuss how there are slight variances in this impact due to the varying AI technolgies used in different sectors.

Using the data from the manufacturing and finance sectors serves as a key exmaple for the need of caution. AI automation in these sectors as well as other fields like transportation is predicted to be the highest by 20234, yet there still exists 
barriers and drawbacks, encouraging organization's to reconsider their approach to AI implementation. Moreover, I decided to use only one data source from Part One, the OECD study on AI in the workplace, as I was uncertain about the public usage of APA data and access to Statistica data involved more investment than what I initially anticipated.

Further changes I made to the presentation include changing the colors of certain slides to create contrast between dark and light areas for a more visually engaging layout. I also modified the first line graph, instead of looking at VC investments from various countries over time, the graph now offers a general look at AI companies to generative AI startups as the country information was not thoroughly utilized in other sections. I also included an explanation for the investment peak around 2021, attributing it to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of stacked bar charts for the work efficiency data, I went with a simple table to display the data as some employers may not be familiar with stacked bar graphs. I also made changes to the employment bar charts by re-ordering the bars so one could make an easy comparison of the decrease and increase side by side. 



# Final thoughts

I found the entire process to both enjoyable and illuminating. find it fascinating how different the final product turned out in comparison to my intitial plans. Gaining feedback from a variety of individuals is very important as it opens my mind to various alternatives and highlights issues within my project I would have difficulty spotting myslef. For this particular project, I was the most excited about working with Shorthand since I love designing presentations, and I found Shorthand to be much more intuitive than Microsoft PowerPoint. If I had more time to complete this project, I would like to revisit the theme of my Shorthand, see if I can embed my Tableau visualizations to better fit the ration of my presentation formatting, and simplify my text to be more clear and impactful for the viewer.
