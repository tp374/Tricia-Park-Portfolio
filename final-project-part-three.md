# Final Writeup

This undertaking of this project began with the brainstorming of an issue or topic I wished to explore further. Since I was already familiar with the growth of generative AI within the arts sector and its negative impact on the artists, I became curious as to how AI implementation impacted other industries. 

In Part One of this process, my topic focused on the comparison of people's sentiments regarding AI's impact with the reality of its effects in the workplace. I created an outline that marked the setup (AI's growth and importance in the marketplace), conflict (integration of AI in the workplace leading to increase in work effiency but decrease in employment), and resolution (recognizing the limitations of AI and spreading awareness of its risks and benefits). I also prepared hand-drawn sketches of what types of data visualizations to include, using information from the following data sources: the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), American Psychology Association (APA), and Statistica. I also planned to use Shorthand to create my presentation and Tableau to create the final visualizations. 

In Part Two, I fleshed out my outline further to include specifics on what text and visualizations will be on which slide of the presentation. After I created a moodboard for my Shorthand slides, which set cool tones of dark and light blues as my visual theme, I created my first draft of the presentation. I also formed an interview script and gained feedback on its presentation, clarity, and engagement. Some key findings and potential changes I found is the mismatch in focus between the text and the visualizations and confusing formatting in the data visualizations. I also received further feedback from the professor and TA, which highlighted the need for clarity in regards to the main points of the visualizations as well as relevancy between the presentation information to my target audience. My target audience was the general adult public, particularly those who are english-speaking, which was later changed in Part Three.


# The final data story

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

In Part Three, I've taken the feedback from Part Two and decided to change my target audience, thus slightly altering the presentation . Narrowing down my target audience to organizations interested in adopting AI tools, I ultimately changed my focus from the employees to employers. While there is little employees can do to in the face of AI's tremendous growth, employers can be more cautious and pro-active in their efforts to mitigate the dangers of AI implementation through research and consutling their workers. Since I had changed the The title of my presentation from "Our Sentiments vs Reality of AIâ€™s Impact: How Worried Should We Be?" to "Should You Implement AI in Your Workplace?" I also changed the call to Action 



## Changes made since Part II

In Part Three, I've taken the feedback from Part Two and decided to change my target audience, thus slightly altering the presentation topic. Narrowing down my target audience to organizations interested in adopting AI tools, I ultimately changed my focus on the employees to the employers. 


 Moreover, I decided to use only one dara source from Part One, the OECD study on AI in the workplace, as the licensing for APA was uncertain and Statistica data involved further than initially 
understanding. 



I also provided additional clarifiaction on the presentation's focus on 
Moreover, I added further clarifaction to the foucus on finance and manufacturing sectors within the presentation as AI usage is highly prevalent in those sectors compared to others. The information within this presentaiton is meant as a simple overview of the effects of AI in large industries, and how it serves to be similar results in other fields. However, at the end of the presentation, I do include how there are slight nuances to this impact due to the varying AI technolgies used in different sectors. Since the target audience was changes, the call to action was also altered. Using the data for the manufacturing and finance sectors as a key example of being cautious, the presentation ends on a note for interested organizations to conduct further research on trends in their industry and consutling their employees before AI adoption.


# Final thoughts
