# Final Writeup

This undertaking of this project began with the brainstorming of an issue or topic I wished to explore further. Since I was already familiar with the growth of generative AI within the arts sector and its negative impact on the artists, I became curious as to how AI implementation impacted other industries. 

In Part One of this process, my topic focused on the comparison of people's sentiments regarding AI's impact with the reality of its effects in the workplace. I created an outline that marked the setup (AI's growth and importance in the marketplace), conflict (integration of AI in the workplace leading to increase in work effiency but decrease in employment), and resolution (recognizing the limitations of AI and spreading awareness of its risks and benefits). I also prepared hand-drawn sketches of what types of data visualizations to include, using information from the following data sources: the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), American Psychology Association (APA), and Statistica. I also planned to use Shorthand to create my presentation and Tableau to create the final visualizations. 

In Part Two, I fleshed out my outline further to include specifics on what text and visualizations will be on which slide of the presentation. After I created a moodboard for my Shorthand slides, which set cool tones of dark and light blues as my visual theme, I created my first draft of the presentation. I also formed an interview script and gained feedback on its presentation, clarity, and engagement. Some key findings and potential changes I found is the mismatch in focus between the text and the visualizations and confusing formatting in the data visualizations. I also received further feedback from the professor and TA, which highlighted the need for clarity in regards to the main points of the visualizations as well as relevancy between the presentation information to my target audience. My target audience was the general adult public, particularly those who are english-speaking, which was later changed in Part Three.

## The audience

In Part Three, I've taken the feedback from Part Two and decided to change my target audience, thus slightly altering the presentation topic. Narrowing down my target audience to organizations interested in adopting AI tools, I ultimately changed my focus from the employees to employers. While there is little employees can do to in the face of AI's tremendous growth, employers can be more cautious and pro-active in their efforts to mitigate the dangers of AI implementation. Ultimately, I had to change the The title of my presentation from "Our Sentiments vs Reality of AIâ€™s Impact: How Worried Should We Be?" to "Should You Implement AI in Your Workplace?" The call to action was also altered, prompting employers to conduct further research on AI trends in their industry and consulting their own workers when deciding on AI adoption.


## Changes made since Part II (fix the grammar in all of these)

Due to the change in target audience, many aspects of the presentation were adjusted. The presenation is intended to be a holistic overview of the benefits and risks of AI adoption within the workplace, with the purpose of informing organizations that AI adoption is a complicated matter that requires thorough study beforehand. Based on the professor's feedback in Part Two, I provided additional clarifiaction on the data's focus on finance and manufacturing sectors. As AI usage is highly prevalent in those sectors compared to others, the data is used as key example of AI's effects on industries. However, at the end of the presentation, I do include how there are slight nuances to this impact due to the varying AI technolgies used in different sectors.

Using the data for the manufacturing and finance sectors as a key example of being cautious. As AI automation in those sectors as well as other fields like transportation is predicted to be the highest by 20234, revealing barriers and drawbacks that still exist for these sectors will prompt any employer to double-take on AI implementation. Moreover, I decided to use only one data source from Part One, the OECD study on AI in the workplace, as I was uncertain about the public usage of APA data and access to Statistica data involved further investment than what I initially thought. 

Further changes I made to the presentation include changing the colors of certain slides to introduce contrast between dark and lighter areas, more change to better visuall engaging. Changed the first line graph, instead of looking at VC investments from various countries over time, having a general view of AI companies to generative AI startups as I did not implement the country information much in my other sections. I also included explanation for the peak around 2021 as the cause was the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of stacked bar charts for the work efficiency survey, I went with a simple table to display the data while highlighting the in red, instead as some employers may not know how to read stacked bar graphs. Changes were also made to the employment bar charts, re-ordering the bars so one could compare the decrease and increase side by side. 



# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

I thought the process was very fun and illuminating. In particular, I find it fascinating how different the final product turned out in comparison to my intitial plans. Gaining feedback from a variety of individuals is very important to opening my mind to various alternatives and issues with my project. For this project, I was the most excited about working with Shorthand, as I often found myself loving designing presentations, and Shorthand felt a lot more intuitive to handle than Microsoft Powerpoint. If I had more time to complete this project, I would wish for a change to revisit the theme of my Shorthand, see if I can embed my Tableau visualizations to better fit the ration of my presentation formatting, and simplifying my text to be more clear and impactful to the viewer.
