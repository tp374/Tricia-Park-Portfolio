### **Assignment 3&4: Critique by Design**

Step 1
Original Data Visualization: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/?tabItem=3345cffa-94a6-4e74-9272-70dee1e0e213#who-uses-each-social-media-platform 


Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization. 

Step 2

Step 3






At a minimum, this portion of your portfolio should all the items mentioned in the instructions (a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.). Make sure to set up a separate page for this assignment and include navigation to and from the page from your main portfolio. 


 written summary and analysis using Markdown, posted to your portfolio page. 

2) document your progress for each step



**Step 4: Interviews for Design Feedback:**

Interviewee: Student mid 20's

Preliminary design 
- What target audience do you think this is directed at?
  "Those in their 20s to 30s."
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
  "These line correspond to social media platforms. I'm seeing the trajectory of their popularity."
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  "I did not think Facebook would be this high and Tiktok so low. These results are pretty suprising to me."
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  "There's not much I would change, but maybe make the data points for Nextdoor and BeReal more noticeable? I barely saw where they were."
- Is there anything you particularly like the most?
  "I really like the y and x axis, simple and to the point. I like how all the years a listed so I can look at a social media's popularity at specific points in time."

Interviewee: Student mid 20's

Preliminary design 2
- What target audience do you think this is directed at?
  "Those who use social media a lot, maybe even familiar with multiple of these on here"
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
  "It's telling me how many americans are using which social media, so basically showing you trends and the popularity of each platform over the years."
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  "I didn't know Facebook was still used so heavily! It must be because of my age bracket too, I mostly use Instagarm and Tiktok."
  "Nothing is too confusing but I wonder why the timeline extends to 2024 when the data seems to end at around 2023."
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  "Maybe space out the lines a bit if that's possible? Since there are so many social media platforms represented here at the bottom, it seems a bit chaotic."
- Is there anything you particularly like the most?
  "I noticed how the colors of each line corresponds to the app designs. I love that little touch, and made it easier to recognize them too."
